Merging .db dublicate entries using DB Browser for SQLite and MATLAB:


Step 1: Generate a copy .db file and open in DB Browser for SQLite:
Replace NULL values with 1:

UPDATE CompoundTable SET mzCloudId = 1
UPDATE SpectrumTable SET blobNoises = 1

Step 2: Open .db file in MATLAB and run script

Step 3: Open modified .db file in SQLiteStudio and copy CompoundRowRemove, newIDX, and SpectrumIDs tables to original .db file

Step 4: Copy and overwrite the values from SpectrumIDs.NewIDs to SpectrumTable.CompoundId:

UPDATE SpectrumTable
SET CompoundId = (SELECT SpectrumIDs.NewIDs FROM SpectrumIDs WHERE SpectrumTable.SpectrumId = SpectrumIDs.ROWID)

Step 5: Remove SpectrumTable Foreign Constraint Key.

Step 6: Delete rows from CompoundTable:

DELETE FROM CompoundTable
WHERE CompoundId IN (SELECT removeIdx FROM CompoundRowRemove)

Step 7: Change CompoundTable.CompoundId Data Type to double

Step 8: Copy and overwrite values from newIDX to CompoundTable.CompoundId:

UPDATE CompoundTable
SET CompoundId = (SELECT newIDX.NewIdx FROM newIDX WHERE CompoundTable.ROWID = newIDX.ROWID)

Step 9: Change CompoundTable.CompoundId Data Type to INTEGER

Step 10: Add SpectrumTable Foreign Constraint Key -> CompoundTable + CompoundId

Step 11: Delete tables: newIDX, SpectrumIDs, and CompoundRowRemove

Step 12: Readd renamed column values

UPDATE CompoundTable SET mzCloudId = NULL
UPDATE SpectrumTable SET blobNoises = NULL

Step 13: PROFIT!!
